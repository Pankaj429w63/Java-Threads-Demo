# 🧵 Java Threads Demo - Pankaj Yadav

This project demonstrates how **multithreading** works in Java using simple mathematical operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. Each operation is implemented in a **separate class**, and each class runs as an independent thread using the `Runnable` interface.

## 🧵 Threaded Operations Description

### 1️⃣ `Addition.java`
- Implements `Runnable`.
- Adds two integers and prints the result.
- Demonstrates a basic thread for arithmetic logic.

### 2️⃣ `Subtraction.java`
- Implements `Runnable`.
- Subtracts one integer from another and prints the result.
- Shows thread execution for subtraction.

### 3️⃣ `Multiplication.java`
- Implements `Runnable`.
- Multiplies two integers and prints the output.
- Highlights thread use for multiplication logic.

### 4️⃣ `Division.java`
- Implements `Runnable`.
- Divides two integers safely (with a check for division by zero).
- Showcases exception-aware thread operation.

### 5️⃣ `Main.java`
- Contains the `main()` method.
- Creates one thread for each of the above classes and starts them.
- Acts as the controller for multithreaded execution.
